# Bastion

Agentic code review for a world where agents write all of the code.

## Why Bastion exists

Agents now write most of the code on a growing number of teams, at a volume closer
to _engineers x 100_ than _x 1_. Two things stop teams from fully unlocking that:

- **Human diff review does not scale.** Asking a 5-person team to review their
  agents' output is like asking 5 people in a 500-person org to review the other
  495. You cannot fix that by trying harder.
- **Without review, codebases rot.** Things go great until they don't, and then
  you have a ball of mud nobody can work in.

Existing agentic reviewers (Copilot, CodeRabbit, and the like) do a decent job, but
they were built for the _old_ world: agentic review _for humans writing code_. They
read the whole diff at once and leave comments for a person to act on, and a single
generic reviewer's recall collapses as you pile on concerns. A 1-item checklist
agent works great; at 10 items it slips; at 100 it is useless. Attention is scarce,
for humans and still for agents, and smarter models do not seem to change that.

## What Bastion does

Bastion runs code review as a set of **single-concern reviewers**: focused agent
prompts, each responsible for exactly one property, run over a changeset. Because
each reviewer owns one concern, it stays at high recall; you cover more ground by
adding narrow reviewers, never by broadening one. The same reviewers run locally
(fast, pre-PR) and in CI (authoritative), and their verdicts aggregate into one
merge gate. The human moves from reviewing diffs to authoring, curating, and
governing the reviewers.

The `bastion` CLI is the local surface: an authoring agent loops `bastion review`
until green, then opens a PR that CI largely just confirms.

For the full motivation, mental model, and threat model, see
[the core design](docs/developer-guide/design.md#the-problem).

## Install

The install scripts detect your platform, download the matching archive from the
latest [GitHub release](https://github.com/jssblck/bastion/releases), verify its
SHA-256 checksum, and put `bastion` on your `PATH`.

**Linux and macOS:**

```sh
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jssblck/bastion/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jssblck/bastion/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

The shell installer accepts `-v/--version`, `-b/--bin-dir`, `-t/--tmp-dir`, and
`-l/--libc` (pass them after `bash -s --`); the PowerShell installer reads the
`Version` and `BinDir` environment variables. Run either with `--help` /
`$env:Help="true"` for details. For example, to pin a version and install location:

```sh
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jssblck/bastion/main/scripts/install.sh | bash -s -- -v 0.1.0 -b /usr/local/bin
```

On Linux the installer autodetects the C runtime: it picks the statically linked
musl build on musl systems and on any host whose glibc is older than 2.35 (or
undetectable), and the glibc build only when the host glibc is 2.35 or newer
(Ubuntu 22.04, Debian 12, RHEL 9, and later). You can force the choice with
`--libc gnu|musl` (or `BASTION_LIBC=...`); the musl build has no glibc dependency
and runs anywhere:

```sh
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jssblck/bastion/main/scripts/install.sh | BASTION_LIBC=musl bash
```

Prefer to do it by hand? Prebuilt binaries for Linux (x86_64 and aarch64, glibc and
musl), macOS (Intel and Apple silicon), and Windows (x86_64) are attached to every
release. Each archive bundles the binary with `README.md`, `LICENSE`, and `NOTICE`,
and the release lists SHA-256 `checksums.txt`:

```sh
# Example: Linux x86_64
curl -sSL https://github.com/jssblck/bastion/releases/latest/download/bastion-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz | tar -xz
sudo install bastion-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/bastion /usr/local/bin/
bastion --version
```

On a system with glibc older than 2.35, swap `gnu` for `musl` in those URLs to get
the static build.

To build from source instead, you need a Rust 2024 toolchain:

```sh
cargo build --release
./target/release/bastion --version
```
