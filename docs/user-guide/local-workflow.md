# The local workflow

> Running `bastion review` for real: the loop, the two output formats, exit codes,
> and inspecting what was saved.

The local CLI is the surface an authoring agent optimizes against before opening a
PR. It runs the *same* reviewers CI will run, so a green local loop usually means a PR
that CI confirms. Two things can make a local run differ: CI feeds reviewers the PR's
description and discussion that a default local run lacks, and a local run also merges
in any personal reviewers from your user-level registry, which CI never sees (see
[Authoring reviewers](./authoring-reviewers.md#user-level-reviewers)). This chapter
covers the loop in depth.

## The loop

The intended use is a tight loop: run the review, read what blocks, fix it, run
again, until green.

```sh
bastion review --base main
```

`bastion review` computes the changeset (working tree vs. `--base`, including
uncommitted and untracked files), selects the reviewers whose triggers match, runs
them in parallel with per-reviewer timeouts, and renders progress and verdicts.

- `--base <branch>`: the branch to diff against. Defaults to `main`.
- `--format <human|jsonl>`: output format. Defaults to `human`.
- `--repo <owner/name>`: the GitHub repository to gather pull request context from. Defaults to `$GITHUB_REPOSITORY`.
- `--pr <number>`: the pull request whose description and discussion the reviewers read as context. Requires a repository, from `--repo` or `$GITHUB_REPOSITORY`; passing `--pr` with no repository is an error.
- `--config-dir <path>`: the user-level config directory to merge personal reviewers from (env `BASTION_CONFIG_DIR`). Defaults to your platform config directory (`~/.config/bastion` on Linux, `~/Library/Application Support/bastion` on macOS, `%APPDATA%\bastion` on Windows). The user-level layer is applied only to a purely local review; a review carrying `--repo`/`--pr` uses the repository's reviewers alone.

The CI workflow passes `--repo`/`--pr` so reviewers see the PR's stated intent and discussion. Locally you rarely need them: with no PR, intent comes from your branch's commit messages (`base..HEAD`), and each reviewer's prior findings come from the run store. When you do pass them, Bastion builds its GitHub REST client from `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_API_URL` (the latter defaults to the public API and points at a GitHub Enterprise host when set). Discussion gathering reads the first 100 conversation comments and the first 100 review comments and does not paginate, so later comments on a very long thread are not included. Gathering PR context is read-only and best effort, so an API or token failure never fails the review; it just drops back to the local context.

### Exit codes

The exit code *is* the gate, so a loop can branch on it:

| Aggregate verdict | Exit code |
| --- | --- |
| `pass` (all gates passed) | `0` |
| `block` (a gate blocked, errored, or timed out) | non-zero |

```sh
# Keep working until every gate is green.
until bastion review --base main; do
  echo "still blocked; fixing..."
  # ... make changes ...
done
```

A blocked review is an *expected* outcome, not a crash: Bastion still exits
cleanly with structured output, and only the code signals the gate.

## Two audiences, two formats

By default `bastion review` renders human-readable progress for a person watching.
An agent passes `--format jsonl` and gets a machine stream instead. Both describe
the same run; only the presentation differs.

### The JSONL stream

With `--format jsonl`, Bastion emits one JSON object per line, as each thing
happens. A run is a typed sequence of events:

```jsonl
{"type":"run.started","run":"r-0f3a","branch":"feat/cart","base":"main","changed":12,"reviewers":[{"name":"file-responsibility","mode":"gate"},{"name":"tenant-isolation","mode":"gate"}]}
{"type":"reviewer.started","run":"r-0f3a","reviewer":"tenant-isolation","mode":"gate","backend":"claude-code"}
{"type":"reviewer.resolved","run":"r-0f3a","reviewer":"tenant-isolation","verdict":"block","summary":"A new query path reads rows without scoping by tenant id.","findings":[{"kind":"blocking","path":"src/server/db.rs","line_start":88,"line_end":91,"detail":"scope this query by tenant_id"}],"usage":{"tokens_in":18204,"tokens_out":1560,"cache_read":12000,"cost_usd":0.21},"duration_ms":38120,"has_transcript":true}
{"type":"run.completed","run":"r-0f3a","verdict":"block","gates":{"total":2,"passed":1,"blocked":1},"duration_ms":41030,"tokens_in":20480,"tokens_out":1875,"cache_read":13100,"cost_usd":0.37}
```

The event types:

| Event | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `run.started` | The run began; lists the reviewers that matched and will run. |
| `reviewer.started` | One reviewer was dispatched. |
| `reviewer.resolved` | One reviewer finished; carries its `verdict`, `summary`, `findings`, `usage`, and a `has_transcript` flag. |
| `run.completed` | The aggregate decision and the gate tally, plus the run's wall-clock `duration_ms` and the usage totals (`tokens_in`, `tokens_out`, `cache_read`, `cost_usd`) summed across reviewers. |

How an agent should consume it:

- **Only need the outcome?** Ignore everything until `run.completed` and read its
  `verdict`.
- **Want to react as you go?** Read each `reviewer.resolved` as it lands and act on
  its `findings`: a `path`, a `line_start`/`line_end`, and a `detail` telling you
  what to change. The findings are everything you need to fix the code.

### For agents: the consumption contract

If you are an agent driving the loop, this is the whole contract:

1. Run `bastion review --base <branch> --format jsonl`.
2. Parse stdout one line at a time as JSON; each line has a `type`.
3. Act on every `reviewer.resolved` with `verdict: "block"` using its `findings`
   (`path` + `line_start`/`line_end` + `detail`). Do not open transcripts; the
   findings already say what to change.
4. The aggregate decision is `run.completed.verdict`. The process also exits
   non-zero on `block`, so you can branch on the exit code alone if you only need
   pass/fail.
5. Fix what blocked and re-run. Loop until `run.completed.verdict` is `pass` (exit
   zero), then open your PR.

This contract is exactly what `bastion skills install` checks into your repo as the
`using-bastion` agent skill, so your agents follow it without being told each time.
See [Teach your agents to use Bastion](./getting-started.md#7-teach-your-agents-to-use-bastion).

### Money is dollars

Cost fields (`cost_usd`) serialize as dollars (`0.21`) even though Bastion tracks
exact cents internally, so you never see floating-point cent drift in the stream.
Token fields (`tokens_in`, `tokens_out`, `cache_read`) are plain integer counts;
on `run.completed` they are the totals summed across every reviewer that reported
usage, the same way `cost_usd` is. `cache_read` is the input tokens served from the
provider's prompt cache (cache hits); each backend names it differently natively
(Claude's `cache_read_input_tokens`, Codex's `cached_input_tokens`, Pi's
`cacheRead`) and Bastion normalizes them to one field. It is 0 when a backend
reports no cache usage.

## What is streamed vs. what is saved

The stream deliberately leaves out the verbose detail. A transcript is mostly noise
to an agent that just wants to know what to fix; streaming thousands of lines on
every run would bury the findings and burn the agent's own context.

- **Streamed:** the decisions and the things you act on immediately: the reviewer
  set, start and resolve events, verdicts, summaries, findings, per-reviewer usage.
- **Saved, not streamed:** the verbose detail: full session transcripts, raw
  verdict payloads, per-reviewer metadata. Written to disk, read on demand.

That is why `reviewer.resolved` carries `has_transcript: true` rather than the
transcript itself: when a decision surprises you, the transcript is one command
away (next section).

## Inspecting saved runs

Every run is persisted, so you can inspect history without re-running anything.
These commands are the local equivalent of clicking "Details" on a CI check. The
run-targeted ones (`show`, `transcript`) default to the latest run when you omit a
run id; `runs` and `clean` operate over all saved runs.

```sh
bastion runs                         # list recent runs: id, verdict, branch, reviewer count
bastion show [<run>]                 # re-print a run's summaries, verdicts, findings
bastion transcript [<run>] <reviewer>   # the full agent session for one reviewer
bastion clean [--keep N | --older-than <dur>]   # prune saved runs
```

- **`runs`** is the index: what ran recently and how each landed.
- **`show`** re-emits a past run's verdicts and findings, the same content as the
  stream's resolve and complete events, on demand. Accepts `--format human|jsonl`.
- **`transcript`** prints the saved session for one reviewer. This is the explicit,
  opt-in way to see what was kept off the stream; reach for it when a verdict is
  surprising and you want to know why. It is raw text (a transcript is already a
  document). Pass either `<reviewer>` (latest run) or `<run> <reviewer>`.
- **`clean`** prunes old runs. `--keep N` retains the N most recent;
  `--older-than <dur>` (e.g. `7d`, `12h`) removes runs older than a duration. The
  two are mutually exclusive.

## Where runs live

Bastion persists every run under a per-user data directory, by platform
convention:

- Linux: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/bastion`, default `~/.local/share/bastion`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/bastion`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\bastion`

Override it with `--data-dir <path>` or the `BASTION_DATA_DIR` environment
variable, handy for scratch runs you do not want in your real history. The layout:

```text
<data-dir>/
  runs/
    r-0f3a/
      run.jsonl                  # the full event stream (always JSONL, regardless of display format)
      reviewers/
        tenant-isolation/
          transcript.jsonl       # the full agent session
          verdict.json           # the raw structured verdict
          meta.json              # backend, timing, usage, matched trigger
    latest                       # a plain file holding the most recent run id
```

`run.jsonl` is the same event stream whether a human or an agent triggered the
run, so any run can be replayed or inspected after the fact. Runs accumulate:
`bastion review` does not prune, so history grows until you run `bastion clean`,
which keeps the most recent 20 when given no arguments (or use `--keep N` /
`--older-than <dur>`).

## Providing environments locally

For a **native** reviewer, the reviewer process inherits Bastion's own environment,
so anything your shell or a `precommit` script has exported (a service on
`http://localhost:3000`, say) is visible to the agent; a reviewer's `env` and
`inputs` values are literal text set in the YAML, not shell-expanded. Bastion only
reads values your shell or CI already exported; it does not stand them up. This is
the same boundary CI honors, which keeps the local and CI surfaces in agreement.

A **containerized** reviewer (one with a
[`runner`](./authoring-reviewers.md#runner-and-capabilities), which today must also set
`capabilities.network: true` to run) does not inherit your shell environment, since it
runs in a container. Into it go the reviewer's literal
`env` pairs plus a fixed provider-credential set, and nothing else. (If the reviewer's
`env` sets one of those credential names, its value wins and the host's is not also
forwarded.) So an exported `PREVIEW_URL` that a native reviewer would see for free
reaches a containerized one only if you write its literal value into that reviewer's
`env`, and a containerized
reviewer typically reaches a host service over the container network rather than
`localhost`.

## The same surface in CI

For the repository's reviewers, these local events are not a separate system from CI;
they are the same decisions in a finer-grained form. Each such JSONL event has a
GitHub twin (a check run, a comment, an annotation), laid out side by side in the
[Continuous integration](./continuous-integration.md#how-a-run-maps-to-github)
chapter. A green local loop predicts a green PR when both runs see the same reviewers
and context. The two surfaces run the repository's reviewers and aggregation, and CI
adds the PR's description and discussion that a default local run does not, so a
reviewer that weighs that context can decide differently. A purely local run can also
include your personal user-level reviewers; their `run.started` and
`reviewer.resolved` events are local-only and never become checks or comments (see
[Authoring reviewers](./authoring-reviewers.md#user-level-reviewers)).
