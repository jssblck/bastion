> Promoting your reviewers into GitHub Actions: one required check and per-author
> billing.

The local loop gets you to green before you open a PR. CI is the authoritative
confirmation: it runs the reviewers from the repository's `.bastion.yaml` and reports
one merge gate. Because routing and aggregation are shared, CI rarely surprises an
author who looped locally. It can differ in two ways: CI adds the PR's description and
discussion that a default local run lacks, and CI runs the repository's reviewers
only, while a local run can also include your personal user-level reviewers (see
[Authoring reviewers](./authoring-reviewers.md#user-level-reviewers)). The user-level
layer is local-only by design, so it can never gate someone else's pull request. This
chapter covers the GitHub adapter, the one forge Bastion targets.

## How a run maps to GitHub

On each pull-request event (`opened`, `synchronize`, `reopened`) the workflow runs
`bastion review`, which computes the changed files, routes to the matching
reviewers, runs them in parallel with per-reviewer timeouts, and persists the run. A
second step, `bastion github report`, reads that run and posts it. A verdict reaches
two GitHub surfaces:

- **Findings are posted to the PR.** `bastion github report` renders every finding
  (blocking and optional) into a single sticky PR comment, and attaches each located
  finding to its reviewer's check run as an annotation on the finding's `path` and
  line range. The sticky comment is the surface an implementing agent reads; it
  carries everything it needs to act.
- **Each verdict becomes a check run** named after the reviewer
  (`bastion / tenant-isolation`). A blocking gate reports `failure`; a passing gate
  reports `success`; an advisor reports `success` with its findings attached.

`bastion github report` also folds a skills-freshness advisory into the sticky comment
when the checked-out repo's bundled skills (`.claude/skills` and `.agents/skills`) are
missing or have drifted from the reporting binary, the same comparison
`bastion skills check` makes. It renders as a `> [!WARNING]` callout just under the
headline, naming each affected file and pointing at `bastion skills install`. It is
advisory only, so it never changes a check-run conclusion or the `bastion` gate; it
tells you to refresh stale skills without failing the build. The local `bastion review`
prints the same notice to stderr.

The local-to-GitHub mapping is one-to-one for the repository's reviewers: the JSONL
events a CI or `bastion review --repo/--pr` run produces are the same decisions GitHub
renders as checks and a comment. (A purely local run can also include your personal
user-level reviewers, whose events are local-only and have no GitHub twin.) Each
GitHub surface has a local twin:

| GitHub                                                         | Local                               |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| A per-reviewer check run reaching its conclusion               | `reviewer.resolved` event           |
| Findings in the sticky PR comment and as check-run annotations | `findings` in `reviewer.resolved`   |
| Tokens and cost in the check output                            | `usage` in `reviewer.resolved`      |
| The aggregate `bastion` check and the sticky PR comment        | `run.completed` event               |
| Transcript in the uploaded run artifact                        | saved on disk, `bastion transcript` |

The local stream additionally carries `run.started` and `reviewer.started` for an
agent reacting as the run goes; those have no separate GitHub surface, because
`bastion github report` runs after the review finishes and renders the result in one
pass. This mapping is deliberate, so an agent's local loop and the CI gate stay
aligned on what a review means.

## The one required check

Branch protection needs you to name the checks that must pass, but Bastion's set of
reviewers *varies per PR*: a docs-only PR and a server PR trigger different
reviewers, so there is no fixed list of names to require.

The fix is a single always-present check, **`bastion`**, and it is the only one
branch protection requires. It runs even when zero reviewers match (a trivial pass)
so it is always there to require. Internally it reflects the aggregate: `success`
only when every triggered gate passed, `failure` if any gate blocked, errored, or
timed out (fail-closed). The per-reviewer checks stay informational; `bastion` is
the gate.

## The workflow

The adapter is a self-hosted workflow that installs a published `bastion`
release plus your backend CLI, authenticates the backend, runs `bastion review`, and
then runs `bastion github report` to post the results to the PR. The CLI exits
non-zero if any gate blocks, so the job's pass/fail *is* your merge gate; the report
step adds the sticky comment and the per-reviewer and aggregate check runs. That host
backend CLI and its auth cover **native** reviewers (the default). A reviewer with a
[`runner`](./authoring-reviewers.md#runner-and-capabilities) runs its backend
*inside a container* instead (and must declare `capabilities.network: true`; without it
the reviewer is rejected before it runs, so a gate blocks and an advisor is skipped), so
for those the job needs a container engine on the runner (`docker` by default, or
whatever `BASTION_CONTAINER_ENGINE` names) and the backend executable plus its auth
inside the image, not on the host. The fixed provider
credential variables are forwarded from the job into the container by name, so the host
auth still reaches a containerized reviewer's provider even though the CLI itself lives
in the image:

```yaml

```

### `bastion github report`

The report step reads the run that `bastion review` just persisted (under
`BASTION_DATA_DIR`) and posts it to the pull request. Its full surface:

```
bastion github report --repo <OWNER/NAME> --pr <N> --sha <SHA> [RUN]
```

- `--repo <OWNER/NAME>`: the repository to post to. Defaults to the
  `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` environment variable that Actions sets, so you can usually
  omit it.
- `--pr <N>`: the pull request number (required).
- `--sha <SHA>`: the head commit the check runs attach to (required); pass the
  PR's `head.sha`, not the merge commit.
- `RUN`: an optional positional run id to report; defaults to the latest recorded
  run, which is what you want right after `bastion review`.

It needs a token with `pull-requests: write` and `checks: write` in `GITHUB_TOKEN`,
and reads `GITHUB_API_URL` (Actions sets it; also the hook for GitHub Enterprise).
Creating check runs requires a GitHub App installation token; both the default
Actions `GITHUB_TOKEN` and a dedicated-app token (see below) are installation
tokens and qualify, while a classic personal access token does not. If the run
cannot be found (an earlier failure persisted nothing), it prints a notice and
exits 0 rather than failing the step a second time. The command is CI-facing and
has no local mirror: locally you read findings straight from
`bastion review --format jsonl`.

### Grouping the checks under their own app

In the PR checks list, the name before the `/` is not the workflow that created a
check; it is the **check suite** the check belongs to, and a check suite is keyed by
`(GitHub App, commit)`. Every GitHub Actions workflow runs under the one shared
`github-actions` app, so a commit that triggers several workflows has several
`github-actions` suites. The check runs `bastion github report` creates through the
REST API carry no suite id (the API does not accept one), so GitHub attaches them to
one of those suites of its own choosing, often a sibling workflow's. The result is
check runs that read like `Security / fail-closed-gates` instead of grouping on
their own.

A check run lands in its own named suite only when a **distinct GitHub App**
creates it. So the fix is to post the report under a small app of your own rather
than the shared Actions identity:

1. Create the app. Go to
   [bastion.jessica.black/github-app](https://bastion.jessica.black/github-app) and
   follow the walkthrough; it shows how to create a GitHub App by hand in GitHub's UI
   with exactly the permissions the report step needs (`checks: write`,
   `pull_requests: write`, `contents: read`, no webhook). The app's **name** is what
   the checks group under, for example `YourOrg's Bastion`.
2. Generate the app's private key, note its numeric App ID, and install the app on
   the repositories that run Bastion.
3. Store `BASTION_APP_ID` (the App ID) and `BASTION_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` (the `.pem`
   contents) as Actions secrets. For Dependabot-triggered runs, set them in the
   Dependabot secret store too.

The workflow above mints a token from those secrets with
[`actions/create-github-app-token`](https://github.com/actions/create-github-app-token)
and hands it to the report step; the per-reviewer and aggregate checks then render
under the app's name. The step is fully optional: with the secrets unset it is
skipped and reporting falls back to the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`, which still posts
the comment and checks, only grouped under whichever suite GitHub picks. When that
happens, `bastion github report` notices (it reads back the app that GitHub stamped
on the check runs it just created) and closes the PR comment with a short note
linking here; once a dedicated app is configured the note disappears. Because the
report reads GitHub's response, the workflow does not pass a flag.

For a complete, working example (latest-release install, per-author backend
credentials, and fork-PR safety), see Bastion's own
[`.github/workflows/bastion.yml`](https://github.com/jssblck/bastion/blob/main/.github/workflows/bastion.yml).
It wires up the per-author auth recipe in [Authentication & billing](#authentication--billing)
below, on the Codex backend.

Configure branch protection on your default branch to require this job (and to
require review of the reviewer-policy paths; see [Governance](./governance.md)).
Merging stays GitHub-native: an author enables auto-merge, and once the required
job is green GitHub merges. A push re-triggers the workflow and it resolves again.

## Authentication & billing

Coding-agent subscriptions tie usage to an individual, not a team, so Bastion bills
a PR's reviews to the *PR author*. Reviewing Alice's PR is billed to Alice's
subscription, which is the ToS-compliant reading: each contributor's plan powers the
review of their own changes. Bastion never stores credentials. The team stores each
author's credential as an Actions secret, and the workflow maps the PR author's
GitHub login to the matching secret at run time.

Bastion just runs your backend CLI, and the backend reads whatever auth it finds on
the runner. Your job in CI is to place the right author's credential where that CLI
looks before `bastion review` runs. The pattern is the same for every backend:

1. **Capture the credential once, locally.** Each contributor signs in to the
   backend on their own machine. The CLI writes a credential file:

   | Backend       | Sign-in            | Credential file the CLI reads                  |
   | ------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
   | `codex`       | `codex login`      | `~/.codex/auth.json` (relocatable: `CODEX_HOME`) |
   | `pi`          | `pi` auth flow     | `~/.pi/agent/auth.json`                         |
   | `claude-code` | `claude` sign-in   | `~/.claude` (OAuth token)                       |

   For a ChatGPT or Claude **subscription**, this file holds an OAuth credential (an
   access token plus a refresh token); the CLI refreshes the short-lived access
   token from the stored refresh token on each run, so the secret does not need
   rotating every time the access token expires. A Codex `auth.json` from a ChatGPT
   sign-in carries `"auth_mode": "chatgpt"`, and the native `backend: codex` reads it
   directly: you do **not** need Pi to spend a ChatGPT subscription (see
   [Spending a subscription in CI](#spending-a-subscription-in-ci) below).

2. **Store it as a per-author secret.** Copy the file's contents into a repository
   secret named `<BACKEND>_AUTH_<LOGIN>`: the backend, then the GitHub login
   uppercased. For the `codex` backend and the login `jssblck`, that is
   `CODEX_AUTH_JSSBLCK`; for `pi`, `PI_AUTH_JSSBLCK`. The name is a convention you
   pick and reference in the workflow, not something Bastion parses.

3. **Map the login to the secret in the workflow.** Resolve
   `github.event.pull_request.user.login` to the matching secret through a `case`
   arm, then write it back to the path the CLI reads:

   ```yaml
   - name: Authenticate Codex as the PR author
     env:
       AUTHOR: ${{ github.event.pull_request.user.login }}
       CODEX_AUTH_JSSBLCK: ${{ secrets.CODEX_AUTH_JSSBLCK }}
     run: |
       set -euo pipefail
       author="$(printf '%s' "$AUTHOR" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')"
       case "$author" in
         jssblck) cred="$CODEX_AUTH_JSSBLCK" ;;
         *)
           echo "::error::No Codex credential mapped for PR author '$AUTHOR'. Add a CODEX_AUTH_<LOGIN> secret and a case arm." >&2
           exit 1 ;;
       esac
       if [ -z "$cred" ]; then
         echo "::error::Codex credential for '$AUTHOR' is mapped but its secret is empty." >&2
         exit 1
       fi
       mkdir -p "$HOME/.codex"
       printf '%s' "$cred" > "$HOME/.codex/auth.json"
       chmod 600 "$HOME/.codex/auth.json"
   ```

   Onboarding a contributor is then two reviewed lines: their secret and a `case`
   arm. Because the mapping lives in the workflow, which is a CODEOWNERS-protected
   path (see [Governance](./governance.md)), changing who may spend a subscription is
   itself a human-reviewed change.

An author with no mapped secret **fails closed**: the step errors and the gate
blocks, rather than silently billing someone else's subscription. If you would
rather a new contributor never be blocked, point the `*)` arm at a shared metered
**API key** instead of erroring: store the provider's API key as a secret and export
it (for example `CODEX_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) into the review step rather
than writing an `auth.json`. The same login-to-secret shape applies. Under heavy
volume a subscription's rate limits can throttle reviewers, and because gates fail
closed a throttled reviewer reads as a blocked merge, so some teams use API billing
in CI and keep subscriptions for the local loop.

### Spending a subscription in CI

A ChatGPT or Claude subscription works in CI the same way it does locally: the
backend CLI reads its OAuth `auth.json` and refreshes the token itself. Use the
backend that matches the subscription you have:

- **`backend: codex` with a ChatGPT subscription.** Sign in with `codex login`
  (ChatGPT), store `~/.codex/auth.json` as `CODEX_AUTH_<LOGIN>`, and rehydrate it to
  `$HOME/.codex/auth.json` as shown above. This is the direct path; no Pi involved.
- **`backend: claude-code` with a Claude subscription.** Same shape against the
  `claude` CLI's auth.
- **`backend: pi` with the `openai-codex` provider.** Pi can also spend a ChatGPT
  subscription, through its `openai-codex` provider (`model: openai-codex/gpt-5.5`).
  Reach for this only when you specifically want Pi's multi-provider routing; for
  plain Codex-on-ChatGPT, the native `codex` backend is simpler.

> **The two `auth.json` files are different.** `~/.codex/auth.json` (Codex CLI) and
> `~/.pi/agent/auth.json` (Pi CLI) are distinct file formats backed by the same
> ChatGPT account. The secret you store must match the backend you pin: a Codex
> `auth.json` rehydrated where Pi looks (or the reverse) will not authenticate. Pick
> the backend first, then capture that CLI's file.

### Dependabot and bot authors

Dependabot opens **same-repo** PRs, so they clear the fork guard and Bastion reviews
them like any other PR. With the `permissions:` block the example workflow declares,
the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` posts the `bastion` check on a Dependabot PR, so you can
require it for those PRs too. There is no read-only-token deadlock to work around.
Dependabot has one required difference for everyone and one extra step that applies
only to per-author billing:

- **Secrets come from a separate store (applies to everyone).** GitHub serves
  secrets to Dependabot-triggered runs from a *Dependabot* secret store, not the
  Actions store. Whatever credential your review step reads, an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
  or a per-author `<BACKEND>_AUTH_<LOGIN>`, must be set in that store as well
  (`gh secret set <NAME> --app dependabot`), or it arrives empty on a Dependabot PR
  and the gate fails closed.
- **A bot has no subscription of its own (per-author billing only).** If you map
  per-author credentials, the bot author needs a `case` arm pointing at a maintainer
  who sponsors its reviews, and the bracketed login must be quoted, since `[bot]` is
  a glob character class in a shell `case` pattern:
  `'dependabot[bot]') cred="$CODEX_AUTH_JSSBLCK" ;;`. An arm that maps to an empty
  secret fails closed with a "mapped but empty" error, usually the sign the
  Dependabot-store copy is missing. Billing with a shared API key instead of
  per-author secrets avoids this entirely: there is no per-author arm to maintain.

### Fork-PR safety

GitHub does not expose secrets to workflows triggered by **fork** pull requests, and
an agentic backend should never run over untrusted code with a live credential
anyway. The example workflow guards on
`github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name == github.repository`, so it runs for
same-repo PRs only. A fork contribution is reviewed by a maintainer re-running it
from a trusted branch in the repo.

## Environments & inputs

Bastion consumes environments; it does not provision them. A reviewer that needs a
preview URL, a database, or any running dependency expects the workflow to have
stood it up and exposed it. Typically an earlier job deploys a preview environment
for the PR and passes its URL into the Bastion job as an environment variable. How
that variable reaches the agent depends on where the reviewer runs. A **native**
reviewer inherits the job environment, so the agent can see it directly. A
**containerized** reviewer (one with a
[`runner`](./authoring-reviewers.md#runner-and-capabilities) and
`capabilities.network: true`) runs in a container and does *not* inherit the arbitrary
job environment. Only the reviewer's literal `env`
pairs cross that boundary (plus a fixed provider-credential set, except that a
credential name set in the reviewer's own `env` wins and is not also forwarded from the
job environment), so a per-PR value reaches a containerized reviewer only if you write
its value into the registry,
typically by templating `.bastion.yaml` before the Bastion job runs. A reviewer's
`env` and `inputs` values are literal (Bastion does not shell-expand them), so to put
a dynamic value into the prompt itself you template the registry or have the prompt
read the variable. Standing up the environment is a deploy concern; Bastion's job
starts once it exists. (See
[Authoring reviewers](./authoring-reviewers.md#env) for the reviewer side.)

## Self-hosting note

Bastion dogfoods the adapter through
[`.github/workflows/bastion.yml`](https://github.com/jssblck/bastion/blob/main/.github/workflows/bastion.yml),
running the latest published `bastion` release rather than a binary built from the
PR's own sources, so a change can never edit the engine that judges it. That workflow
is a concrete, self-hosted instance of everything this chapter describes.
