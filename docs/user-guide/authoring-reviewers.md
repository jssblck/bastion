# Authoring reviewers

> The registry schema in full, and how to write a reviewer that stays sharp.

Reviewers are the whole policy. This chapter is the reference for writing them:
the file, the required fields, the optional execution profile, and the craft of a
prompt that keeps recall high. It progresses from the minimum you need to the
fields you will reach for only occasionally.

## The registry file

All reviewers live in one file at your repository root: `.bastion.yaml` (the
`.bastion.yml` spelling is also honored). Bastion finds it by walking up from the
current directory, so the command works anywhere inside the repo. The file is a
single `reviewers:` list:

```yaml
reviewers:
  - name: single-responsibility
    trigger: [src/**/*.rs]
    mode: gate
    prompt: |
      ...
  - name: test-coverage
    trigger: [src/**/*.rs]
    mode: advisor
    prompt: |
      ...
```

Reviewer **names must be unique** within the file; a duplicate name is a load
error. Because this file *is* the review policy, changes to it should require human
review; see [Governance](./governance.md) and `bastion github codeowners`.

> **Migrating from `bastion/reviewers.yaml`.** Bastion still loads the legacy
> `bastion/reviewers.yaml` location but prints a deprecation warning; the supported
> location is `.bastion.yaml` at your repository root. Move the file (the contents
> are unchanged) and regenerate your CODEOWNERS block with `bastion github
> codeowners`.

## Registry-wide defaults

An optional top-level `defaults:` block sets a house `model` and `effort` that
every reviewer inherits unless it sets its own. A reviewer's explicit field always
wins; the default just fills the gap, so you set the model and effort once instead
of repeating them on every reviewer:

```yaml
defaults:
  model: gpt-5
  effort: high
reviewers:
  - name: single-responsibility
    trigger: [src/**/*.rs]
    mode: gate
    backend: codex      # required: an inherited model needs a pinned backend
    prompt: |
      ...
```

A default `model` is still backend-specific, so a reviewer that inherits it must
pin a `backend`; an inherited model under `backend: any` is rejected the same way
an explicit one is. `defaults` sits *above* each backend's own built-in default
(Opus 4.8 at `high` effort on Claude Code), so the resolution order is: the
reviewer's own field, then `defaults`, then the backend default.

## The required fields

Four fields are mandatory. A reviewer with just these is complete and runnable.

### `name`

A unique identifier. It is also the reviewer's check-run name in CI
(`bastion / single-responsibility`), so keep it short and descriptive.

### `trigger`

A list of path globs matched against the changed files. The reviewer runs if any
changed file matches any glob. Globs use the usual `**` (any depth) and `*` (one
segment) syntax:

```yaml
trigger: [src/**/*.rs]                       # all Rust under src, any depth
trigger: [src/server/**, src/client/**]      # either subtree
trigger: [src/**/*.rs, docs/**/*.md, ".bastion.yaml"]   # multiple kinds
```

Quote a glob if YAML would otherwise mis-parse it (a bare leading `*`, for
instance). Scope triggers tightly: a narrow trigger is what keeps an irrelevant
reviewer from waking on every change.

### `mode`

`gate` (blocks the merge when it returns `block`; fails closed) or `advisor`
(never blocks; fails open). See [Concepts](./concepts.md#the-mode-gate-vs-advisor)
for the full semantics.

### `prompt`

The instruction handed to the reviewing agent. This is where the craft lives; see
[Writing a good prompt](#writing-a-good-prompt) below.

## The optional execution profile

The remaining fields tune *how* a reviewer runs. All have defaults; omit them
until you need them.

### `backend`

Which agent harness runs the reviewer. Default `any` (resolves to Claude Code).
Pin `claude-code`, `codex`, or `pi` to force a specific harness, usually
because a subscription's terms require it, or because one model is better at a
given concern.

```yaml
backend: codex
```

> `pi` is multi-provider. Pin its provider and model together in the [`model`](#model)
> field using Pi's `provider/id` form (e.g. `openai-codex/gpt-5.5`); omit `model` to
> run against whatever provider and model your local Pi CLI defaults to.

### `model`

The specific model the backend should use, for example `claude-opus-4-8` on Claude
Code or `gpt-5` on Codex. A model id is **backend-specific**, so pinning one
requires a pinned `backend`: a `model` under `backend: any` is rejected when the
registry loads, since Bastion cannot know which backend the id is meant for.

```yaml
backend: codex
model: gpt-5
```

Under `backend: pi` the model also names its **provider**, written in Pi's
`provider/id` form, because Pi is multi-provider and its bare default provider is
`google`. So a Pi reviewer that wants an OpenAI Codex model writes the provider into
the id rather than a separate field:

```yaml
backend: pi
model: openai-codex/gpt-5.5
```

Omit it to take the backend's default. On Claude Code that default is **Opus 4.8**;
on Codex and Pi it is whatever the harness itself resolves (for Pi, its configured
default provider and model). To set a model once for the whole registry rather than
per reviewer, use the [`defaults`](#registry-wide-defaults) block.

### `effort`

The reasoning-effort level, forwarded verbatim to the active backend's effort
control (Claude Code's `--effort`, Codex's `model_reasoning_effort`, Pi's
`--thinking`). Like `model`, the value is opaque: use whatever vocabulary your
backend accepts. Claude Code takes `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, or `max`; Codex
takes `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, or `high`; Pi takes `off`, `minimal`, `low`,
`medium`, `high`, or `xhigh`. The shared `low`/`medium`/`high` levels work on any
backend; the backend-specific ones do not, so a value that does not match the
reviewer's backend is the backend's problem (Claude Code, for instance, warns and
falls back to its own default).

```yaml
effort: high
```

The default is **`high`** (accepted by every backend). Lower it on cheap,
mechanical reviewers to save tokens; raise it on the ones that need to reason hard.

### `timeout`

A per-reviewer wall-clock limit, written in human form (`90s`, `15m`). When a
reviewer exceeds it, a gate fails closed (block) and an advisor is skipped. The
default is **15 minutes**. Set a short timeout on cheap reviewers and a long one on
heavy end-to-end checks:

```yaml
timeout: 15m
```

### `env`

Environment variables injected into the reviewer's process, so the agent and any
tool it runs can see them. Use this to hand a reviewer a value your environment
already provides, say a preview URL:

```yaml
env:
  PREVIEW_URL: http://localhost:3000
```

Values are **literal**: Bastion does not perform shell `$VAR` expansion, so write
the actual value, not `${SOMETHING}`. Bastion consumes environments, it does not
provision them: locally the value must already exist (a precommit script might boot
the service and export it), and in CI the workflow stands it up. See
[Continuous integration](./continuous-integration.md#environments--inputs).

How the value reaches the agent depends on where the reviewer runs:

- **Native reviewers** (no `runner`) also inherit Bastion's own environment, so a
  variable your shell or CI has already exported is visible to the agent even
  without listing it here; the `env` block sets additional values explicitly.
- **Containerized reviewers** (with a `runner` and `capabilities.network: true`) do
  *not* inherit Bastion's arbitrary environment. Into the container go exactly the `env` pairs written here
  (as literal values, the same as everywhere else) plus a fixed set of
  model-provider credential variables (see [Backends](./concepts.md#the-backend)).
  Nothing else crosses, so a value an outer shell or CI job exported reaches a
  containerized reviewer only if its literal value is written into this `env` block
  (template the registry if the value is dynamic, for example a per-PR preview URL).
  For a containerized reviewer the `env` pairs are written to a temporary file handed
  to the engine as `--env-file`, so their values never appear on the `docker run`
  command line (a secret in `env` stays out of a process listing) and their names
  never touch the engine *client* process; the provider credentials are the only
  variables forwarded by name from Bastion's own environment. If you set one of those
  provider credential names in this `env` block, your value wins: Bastion does not also
  forward the host's value for that name, so the reviewer's `env` overrides it (matching
  how a native reviewer's `env` overrides the inherited environment). One container-only
  constraint follows from that env-file format (one `KEY=VALUE` per line, no escaping):
  a containerized reviewer's `env` cannot carry a key containing a newline or `=`, or a
  value containing a newline. Such a pair is rejected and the reviewer fails closed
  rather than receive a corrupted value; a multiline value (a PEM key, say) has to
  reach a containerized reviewer some other way (a file in the image, or one its
  Dockerfile copies in). Native reviewers have no such limit.

### `inputs`

Values interpolated into the prompt *before* it reaches the agent. Reference an
input as `${name}` in the prompt; Bastion substitutes the value. Unknown
placeholders are left untouched.

```yaml
inputs:
  preview_url: http://localhost:3000
prompt: |
  Run the checkout flow against the preview environment at `${preview_url}`.
  If it fails, block the PR and explain; otherwise approve it.
```

`env` puts a value in the *process*; `inputs` puts a value in the *prompt text*.
They are independent: use `env` for tools the agent invokes, `inputs` for values
the agent should read in its instructions. Input values are literal as well: a
`${name}` in the prompt is substituted only from this `inputs` map, never from your
shell environment.

### `runner` and `capabilities`

The schema also accepts a `runner` block (`dockerfile` / `image`) and a
`capabilities` block (`network`, `mcp`, `skills`) to opt into an execution
environment beyond the least-privilege default. Where these stand:

- **`runner` is provisioned (paired with `network: true`).** A reviewer with a
  `runner` block and `capabilities.network: true` runs its backend
  inside a container: a `dockerfile` is built (tagged by a content hash of the
  Dockerfile, so an unchanged file reuses the engine's layer cache), an `image` is used
  as-is (the engine pulls it on demand at run time). If both are set, `dockerfile`
  wins; a `runner` with neither
  fails closed. The `dockerfile` path is relative to the repository root and must
  resolve inside it: an absolute path, any path with a `..` component (rejected
  outright, even one that would resolve back inside), or one that canonicalizes outside
  the repo through a symlink all fail closed. The build runs
  with the repository root as its build context, so the Dockerfile's `COPY` and `ADD`
  can reference files anywhere in the repo. An `image` reference beginning with `-`
  fails closed, since the engine would read it as a command-line option rather than an
  image name. The selected backend's executable must exist inside the image on `PATH`
  (`claude` for `claude-code`, `codex` for `codex`). This lets a reviewer carry tools
  or a pinned toolchain the host does not have.
- **`capabilities.network: true` is required to run a container; the default
  `network: false` fails closed.** `network: true` gives a containerized reviewer
  general (unscoped) outbound network. A container's egress cannot be scoped to the
  model provider yet (the allowlisting proxy is unbuilt), so the default
  `network: false` reads as restricted but cannot be enforced: rather than silently
  attach general egress, `ExecutionPlan::resolve` rejects a container with
  `network: false` before it runs. As with `mcp`/`skills`, that rejection **fails
  closed**: a gate blocks and an advisor is skipped, with a message naming the field. A
  containerized reviewer must opt into `network: true` to run, accepting general egress
  for now. A *native* `network: true` (no `runner`) also fails closed, since with no
  container there is nothing to scope.
- **`capabilities.mcp` and `capabilities.skills` are not provisioned.** A
  reviewer that declares either **fails closed**: a gate blocks and an advisor is
  skipped, with a message naming the unprovisioned field, rather than running
  degraded (a gate that quietly ran without a privilege it asked for would be a
  silent fail-open). Leave them out.

The least-privilege default (no `runner`, `network: false`, no `mcp` or `skills`)
runs natively on the host. The authoritative description is in the
[core design](../developer-guide/design.md#the-reviewer).

## A fully-loaded example

Putting the optional fields together. As written, this reviewer runs in the container
built from its Dockerfile. It must declare `network: true` to run (a containerized
reviewer needs general egress, since provider-only scoping is unbuilt), and Bastion
forwards its `env` into that container.

```yaml
reviewers:
  - name: e2e-checkout-flow
    trigger: [src/**]
    mode: gate
    backend: claude-code
    timeout: 15m
    env:
      PREVIEW_URL: http://localhost:3000     # literal value, no shell expansion
    inputs:
      preview_url: http://localhost:3000     # substituted into the prompt as ${preview_url}
    runner:                                  # provisioned: runs the backend in this image
      dockerfile: ./.bastion/e2e.Dockerfile
    capabilities:
      network: true                          # required to run a container; grants general (unscoped) egress
    prompt: |
      Run the e2e checkout flow against the preview environment at `${preview_url}`
      using Playwright. If it fails, block the PR and explain; otherwise approve it.
```

Adding an unprovisioned capability flips the whole reviewer to fail closed. For
example, adding `mcp: [playwright]` under `capabilities` would block this gate before
it ever reaches the container, since `mcp` is checked first. Leave `mcp` and `skills`
out until those tiers land.

## Writing a good prompt

The prompt is the reviewer. A few habits keep recall high:

- **Say what to block on, explicitly.** End with a clear instruction: "block the
  PR if X; otherwise approve it." The reviewer's job is a decision, not an essay.
- **Name the one concern and stay on it.** If you find yourself writing "also
  check...", that "also" is a second reviewer. Split it.
- **Carve out the false positives you can predict.** "A single large but cohesive
  module is not a violation." "Panics in `#[cfg(test)]` code are acceptable."
  Pre-empting the obvious wrong flags keeps false positives down.
- **Match the mode to the language.** A gate's prompt should be decisive; an
  advisor's should say "report as optional findings... do not block," so its
  output stays advisory even if the model is tempted to be firm.
- **Let the agent explore.** Every reviewer gets a full checkout and is told how to
  see the changeset (the diff against the base, plus untracked files). You do not
  need to paste the diff into the prompt; point the reviewer at the property.
- **You do not need to ask for completeness.** Bastion appends an instruction to
  every reviewer prompt telling the agent to report every distinct finding in one
  pass, not just the first. Write the prompt for the concern and phrase findings
  per instance (one per file and line range), and the agent enumerates them all so
  the author fixes the whole set from one run.

Some worked examples, taken from Bastion's own registry
([`.bastion.yaml`](../../.bastion.yaml)):

```yaml
  - name: error-handling
    trigger: [src/**/*.rs]
    mode: gate
    backend: pi
    prompt: |
      Review the changeset for error-handling discipline: no `.unwrap()` or
      `.expect()` on recoverable errors in non-test code, errors propagated with
      `?` and given context, and gates that fail closed. Block the PR if you find
      a recoverable error that can panic in production; otherwise approve it.
      Panics in `#[cfg(test)]` code and in genuinely-unreachable invariants that
      are documented as such are acceptable.

  - name: test-coverage
    trigger: [src/**/*.rs]
    mode: advisor
    backend: pi
    prompt: |
      Check whether new or changed behavior in this changeset is covered by
      tests. This is advisory: report uncovered behavior as optional findings so
      the author can decide, but do not block.
```

## Validating your registry

There is no separate lint command; the registry is validated when it loads, before
any agent runs. Run `bastion review` and Bastion will report a malformed file, a
duplicate name, or a reviewer missing a required field with a clear error.
