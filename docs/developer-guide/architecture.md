Bastion is a small, flat crate: a thin binary over a library, with one module per
concern. This chapter is the map: where each thing lives, and how a review flows
through it.

## The module map

| Module | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| [`build.rs`](../../build.rs) | Derives `BASTION_VERSION` from `git describe --always --tags --dirty=-dirty`, with a `BASTION_VERSION` env override and a `Cargo.toml` fallback. |
| [`src/main.rs`](../../src/main.rs) | Thin binary entrypoint; wires the tokio runtime to `bastion::run`. |
| [`src/lib.rs`](../../src/lib.rs) | Library root; installs `color_eyre` + `tracing` and dispatches. |
| [`src/version.rs`](../../src/version.rs) | Exposes the build-derived version string. |
| [`src/cli.rs`](../../src/cli.rs) | The clap derive command tree and dispatch; maps a `block` aggregate to a non-zero exit. |
| [`src/commands.rs`](../../src/commands.rs) | One handler per subcommand. |
| [`src/reviewer.rs`](../../src/reviewer.rs) | The declarative reviewer schema (`Reviewer`, `Mode`, `Backend`, `Capabilities`, `RunnerSpec`). |
| [`src/config.rs`](../../src/config.rs) | Registry loading, discovery, and merge. Walks up for a repository `.bastion.yaml` or `.bastion.yml` (with a deprecated `bastion/reviewers.yaml` fallback that warns) and, via `discover_merged`, layers in a user-level registry from the platform config dir (`user_config_dir`, override `BASTION_CONFIG_DIR`). The merge is a set keyed by name: an identical reviewer in both files is deduplicated, and a same-name-different-config collision keeps both with the repo side scoped to `REPO_SCOPE_PREFIX` (`repo:`). Validates name uniqueness and run-store path-component uniqueness over the merged set. |
| [`src/routing.rs`](../../src/routing.rs) | Compiling trigger globs and matching them against changed files. |
| [`src/verdict.rs`](../../src/verdict.rs) | The structured verdict (`Decision`, `Verdict`, `Finding`, `Usage`, and `Money`, which carries cents but serializes as dollars). |
| [`src/context.rs`](../../src/context.rs) | The transport-neutral review context (`ReviewContext`): the author's stated intent, the surrounding discussion (`ContextComment` with a generic `Standing`), and a reviewer's prior findings (`PriorFinding`, keyed by a content-derived `FindingId`). A producer fills it; the backends consume it through `render_for`. Everything in it is untrusted input. |
| [`src/event.rs`](../../src/event.rs) | The run-event schema streamed as JSONL and persisted to `run.jsonl`. |
| [`src/git.rs`](../../src/git.rs) | The git queries the CLI needs (changed files, branch, repo root, and the `base..HEAD` commit messages that serve as local intent when there is no PR body). |
| [`src/paths.rs`](../../src/paths.rs) | The data-directory layout (`Layout`), resolved by platform convention or `BASTION_DATA_DIR`. Maps a reviewer name to a portable run-store path component (`path_component`), so the `repo:` merge sentinel cannot produce an unwritable path; `config.rs` enforces that distinct names never collapse to the same component. |
| [`src/store.rs`](../../src/store.rs) | Run-history persistence: writing/reading `run.jsonl`, listing and pruning runs, and recalling a branch's prior findings (`prior_findings`) from its last run for the review context. |
| [`src/render.rs`](../../src/render.rs) | Human and JSONL output (`Format`). |
| [`src/runner.rs`](../../src/runner.rs) | The parallel, timeout-bounded runner: fans matched reviewers out over a `JoinSet`, fails closed on error/timeout, streams events, persists each run. |
| [`src/skills.rs`](../../src/skills.rs) | The agent skills bundled into the binary (from `skills/<slug>/SKILL.md`) and installed into a consuming repo by `bastion skills install`/`check`/`list`. The rendered file is deterministic so `check` is a version-independent drift guard. |
| [`src/backend/`](../../src/backend/) | The agent execution boundary. See [Backends](./backends.md). |
| [`src/github/`](../../src/github/) | The GitHub adapter (CI surface): `codeowners.rs` generates the governance block, `client.rs` is the `reqwest`-backed REST seam (a proof-carrying `ApiRequest` plus a `GitHubApi` trait and a recording test double, modeled on the backend's `CommandRunner`), `report.rs` posts a finished run as a sticky PR comment and check runs, and `context.rs` gathers a PR's description and discussion into a `ReviewContext` (the GitHub producer). See the [GitHub adapter](./github-adapter.md). |

## The two boundaries that shape the design

Two seams are worth understanding before you change anything, because most of the
structure exists to keep them honest.

- **The backend boundary** ([`src/backend/`](../../src/backend/)). Bastion does not
  run agent loops; it shells out to existing agent CLIs. The `Backend` trait, the
  `CommandRunner` subprocess seam, and `dispatch` isolate everything agent- and
  subprocess-specific so the runner above stays pure orchestration and the tests
  drive real backends against a fake executable. Covered in
  [Backends](./backends.md).
- **The parse-don't-validate boundary** (`config.rs` -> `reviewer.rs` ->
  `routing.rs`). Untrusted text (the YAML registry, git output, CLI args) is parsed
  *once* at the edge into precise types (a `Reviewer`, a compiled glob matcher, a
  `RunId`) rather than carried around stringly-typed and re-checked. Covered in
  [Conventions](./conventions.md).

## The life of a `bastion review`

Following one review top to bottom touches most of the crate:

1. **Parse & resolve** (`cli.rs`). clap parses the command. The data directory is
   resolved into a `Layout` (`paths.rs`), from `--data-dir`/`BASTION_DATA_DIR` or
   the platform default. The user-level config directory is resolved the same way,
   from `--config-dir`/`BASTION_CONFIG_DIR` or the platform default; it is passed
   into a purely local review but withheld from a governed one (a review carrying a
   GitHub source via `--repo`/`--pr`), so CI never merges ungoverned reviewers.
2. **Load policy** (`config.rs`). `discover_merged` finds the repository registry by
   walking up from the cwd for `.bastion.yaml` (or `.bastion.yml`) and merges in the
   user-level registry from the config dir, layering the two reviewer lists into one
   validated set (identical reviewers deduplicated, a same-name-different-config
   collision keeping both with the repo side scoped to `repo:`). Either source alone
   suffices; only the absence of both is an error. The merged set is parsed into
   `Config` and validated (unique names and unique run-store path components).
   Malformed input fails here, before any agent runs.
3. **Compute the changeset** (`git.rs`). Bastion asks git for the files that differ
   from `--base` (tracked edits *and* untracked files, committed or not) plus the
   current branch and repo root.
4. **Route** (`routing.rs`). Each reviewer's trigger globs are compiled and matched
   against the changed files; the matched reviewers are the ones that will run.
5. **Gather context** (`context.rs`, `git.rs`, `store.rs`, `github/context.rs`).
   Bastion assembles a `ReviewContext` for the run: the author's stated intent (a
   non-empty PR body when reviewing a pull request, otherwise this branch's commit
   messages as the fallback), the prior findings recalled from the last run of this
   branch, and (on GitHub) the PR's discussion. It is best effort: a failure to reach GitHub falls back to the local
   context. Empty context leaves every reviewer's prompt unchanged.
6. **Run** (`runner.rs`). `execute` spawns every matched reviewer onto a `JoinSet`,
   bounds each by its `timeout` (default 15m), and emits `reviewer.started` up
   front. Each task calls `backend::dispatch` (`backend/mod.rs`), which resolves the
   reviewer's `ExecutionPlan` (failing closed on an unprovisioned capability tier),
   selects the concrete backend, and runs the agent either natively or inside a
   container for a reviewer with a `runner` block and `capabilities.network: true`
   (`backend/container/`; see [Containers](./containers.md)).
7. **Resolve & aggregate** (`runner.rs`). Each result has fail-closed/fail-open
   policy applied: a gate that blocks, errors, or times out resolves to `block`
   (with a synthetic blocking finding); an advisor that fails is dropped. The
   aggregate is `block` if any gate blocked, else `pass`.
8. **Emit & persist** (`render.rs`, `store.rs`). Events stream out as human text or
   JSONL as they happen; the full event stream, plus per-reviewer transcript,
   verdict, and metadata, is written under the run's directory, and `latest` is
   updated.
9. **Exit** (`cli.rs`). The aggregate `Decision` maps to the process exit code:
   `pass` -> success, `block` -> failure, so an agent loop and CI agree on the gate.

The read-back commands (`transcript`, `show`, `runs`, `clean`) skip steps 3-7 and
read the persisted run store directly.

## Why the runner owns persistence

`execute` owns both event emission *and* persistence, so `commands::review` only
has to render the stream and map the aggregate to an exit code. This is deliberate:
it keeps the `run.jsonl` on disk identical to the live stream (it even reconstructs
the authoritative `run.started` and prepends the retained `reviewer.started` events
so a replay sees the exact sequence the live run emitted), and it means there is
one place, not two, that decides what a run records.
