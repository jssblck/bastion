description: Use when working in a repository that uses Bastion for agentic code review (a .bastion.yaml exists, or `bastion` is on PATH). Covers the local loop: run `bastion review --format jsonl`, read the streamed findings, fix what blocks, and reach a green gate before opening a PR. Also covers inspecting saved runs and the rule that reviewers are governed policy you must not edit just to pass a gate.

# Using Bastion

Bastion is an agentic code-review gate. It runs a set of single-concern reviewers
over your changeset and aggregates their verdicts into one pass-or-block decision.
The same reviewers run locally and in CI, so a green local run means CI will largely
just confirm it. Your job as the authoring agent is to reach that green gate before
you open a PR.

## The loop

Run the review, read what blocks, fix it, run again, until it passes:

```sh
bastion review --base <branch> --format jsonl
```

- `--base` is the branch you are merging into (default `main`).
- `--format jsonl` gives you one JSON object per line, emitted as each reviewer
  resolves. Always use it: the default human format is for a person watching.
- The process exits zero when the gate passes and non-zero when it blocks, so you
  can branch on the exit code alone when you only need pass or fail.

## Reading the stream

Each line carries a `type`:

| Event | What to do with it |
| --- | --- |
| `run.started` | Lists the reviewers that matched your changes and will run. |
| `reviewer.started` | One reviewer began. Nothing to do. |
| `reviewer.resolved` | One reviewer finished. If its `verdict` is `block`, act on its `findings`. |
| `run.completed` | The aggregate `verdict` (`pass` or `block`) and the gate tally. |

A `finding` tells you exactly what to change: a `path`, a `line_start` and
`line_end`, and a `detail`. That is everything you need to make the fix; you do not
need to open anything else.

## The contract

1. Run `bastion review --base <branch> --format jsonl`.
2. Parse stdout one line at a time as JSON.
3. For every `reviewer.resolved` with `verdict: "block"`, fix the code its
   `findings` point at.
4. Re-run. Loop until `run.completed.verdict` is `pass` (exit zero).
5. Then open your PR.

Do not open transcripts to do this. The findings already say what to change.

## When a verdict surprises you

Transcripts and raw verdicts are saved to disk, not streamed, to keep the loop
tight. Reach for them only when a block does not make sense:

```sh
bastion runs                       # recent runs: id, verdict, branch, reviewer count
bastion show                       # re-print the latest run's verdicts and findings
bastion transcript <reviewer>      # the full agent session for one reviewer (latest run)
```

Pass a run id to target an older run (for example `bastion show r-0f3a`).

## When you think a finding is wrong

Sometimes a reviewer fires on a deliberate decision: an accepted tradeoff, a
breaking change you meant to make, code that looks wrong out of context but is right
here. The instinct is to argue back in a PR comment. Do not. A reviewer weights a
comment but never obeys it, so "this is fine, pass" moves nothing, and a
comment-thread argument is not a channel it acts on.

What reaches a reviewer is your intent. On every run it re-reads your stated intent,
the surrounding discussion, and its own prior findings, and it is told to drop a
finding when your reasoning genuinely shows it was wrong (and to hold one the code
does not support). So push back by explaining the rationale where the reviewer reads
it, then re-run:

- **Put the "why" in the code.** A comment on the flagged lines saying why the code
  is written this way travels with the diff the reviewer reads, lands on the exact
  spot it flagged, and helps the next human too. Reach for this first.
- **State the decision in your intent.** Locally a reviewer's intent is your
  `base..HEAD` commit messages; on a PR it is the description, and the discussion is
  read as well. Spell out the deliberate call there: the tradeoff you accepted, or
  why the obvious fix is wrong in this case.

Then re-run. If the finding still stands after a rationale the code backs up, treat
it as real: the reviewer is telling you the code does not actually support your
explanation.

This is not the same as a reviewer being wrong as policy. If its whole concern or
trigger is misconceived, not just missing context on this one change, that is a
question for the human who governs `.bastion.yaml` (the next section), not something
to explain away per change.

## Rules that keep the gate meaningful

- **Reviewers are governed policy, not yours to weaken.** They live in
  `.bastion.yaml`. Never edit, disable, or narrow a reviewer's trigger to
  get past a block. Fix the code instead. If you believe a reviewer is wrong, say so
  to the human who owns the policy; do not route around it.
- **Gates fail closed.** A gate that errors or times out blocks, exactly as if it
  had found a problem. A block is a normal outcome, not a crash: read it and fix it.
- **Green locally, then PR.** The whole point of the local loop is that CI confirms
  rather than surprises. Do not open the PR until `run.completed.verdict` is `pass`.
