//! Turning a finished run into GitHub surfaces: a sticky PR comment and check runs.
//!
//! This is the reporting half of the adapter. It reads the same [`RunEvent`]
//! stream the local surface renders and `run.jsonl` persists, and maps it onto two
//! GitHub surfaces described in `docs/developer-guide/github-adapter.md`:
//!
//! - **One sticky PR comment** carrying every reviewer's verdict and *all* of its
//!   findings, blocking and optional alike. Optional findings never gate, so this
//!   is the one place a reader sees them without opening the run artifact; the
//!   comment is upserted in place (matched by a hidden marker) so a re-run rewrites
//!   it rather than stacking duplicates.
//! - **A check run per reviewer plus an always-present aggregate `bastion` check**,
//!   so the PR's checks list shows exactly which reviewers ran and how each landed.
//!   A blocking gate reports `failure`; a passing gate and any advisor report
//!   `success`. Located findings ride along as check annotations.
//!
//! The report renders the run the runner already decided. The runner is what
//! enforces the gate semantics: it fails a gate closed at write time (a crashed or
//! timed-out gate is persisted as a block with a synthetic blocking finding) and
//! clamps every advisor to a pass while keeping its findings. So this half does not
//! re-derive the merge decision; it trusts the recorded `run.completed` verdict and
//! each reviewer's recorded row, and draws them onto the two surfaces. The persisted
//! run is a trusted artifact: Bastion's threat model is aligned contributors, not a
//! forged run file (see `docs/user-guide/governance.md`).
//!
//! The one boundary check it keeps is gate-verdict consistency: a gate recorded as a
//! `pass` that still carries a blocking finding contradicts itself, so the report
//! fails it closed rather than publishing a green check off it. The backends already
//! reject such a verdict upstream, so this is a fail-closed safeguard at the boundary,
//! not a recomputation of the gate.
//!
//! All the event-to-markdown and event-to-payload mapping here is pure and unit
//! tested; the only side effects are the [`GitHubApi`] calls in [`report`].
