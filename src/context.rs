//! The review context: what a reviewer is told *about* a changeset beyond the
//! diff itself.
//!
//! A reviewer runs as a fitness function over a changeset. A reviewer that sees only
//! the diff re-litigates settled questions. It re-raises a finding the author already
//! addressed or pushed back on, and it flags a deliberate decision (a breaking
//! migration, a knowingly-accepted tradeoff) as a defect because the *why* lives in the
//! pull request, not the code. [`ReviewContext`] carries that missing context: the
//! author's stated intent, the surrounding discussion, and the reviewer's own prior
//! findings on the same change.
//!
//! This module is deliberately transport-neutral. It knows nothing about GitHub,
//! pull requests, or `author_association`. The local loop and the GitHub adapter are
//! each a *producer* that fills a [`ReviewContext`]; the runner and the backends only
//! ever consume one. The seam is a plain data type, populated by the active transport
//! and consumed the same way by the runner and backends. GitHub-specific notions
//! (an `author_association`, a reply thread) are mapped onto the generic [`Standing`]
//! and [`FindingId`] at the adapter boundary and never leak inward.
//!
//! Everything here is **untrusted input**. The author and bystanders supply it, and the
//! prompt frames it as claims to check against the code. [`Standing`] lets a reviewer
//! *weight* a maintainer's word above a stranger's, but it affects only the prompt
//! wording; the gate logic ignores it, so no comment can flip a decision.
