//! Bastion does not run its own agent loop; it translates a reviewer's execution
//! profile into a backend's native config and shells out to that backend's CLI
//! (`docs/developer-guide/design.md`). This module defines the contract: [`Backend`], what it is
//! handed ([`ReviewRequest`]) and what it must return ([`ReviewOutcome`]), plus
//! the concrete backends and the dispatch that picks one for a reviewer.
//!
//! The subprocess boundary lives behind [`command::CommandRunner`] so backends can
//! be driven against a fake executable in tests, with no real agent or network.
