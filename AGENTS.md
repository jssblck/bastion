# AGENTS.md

Guidance for coding agents working in this repository.

## Project overview

Bastion is a Rust 2024 agentic code-review system. Single-concern reviewers run
as fitness functions over a changeset, both locally (the `bastion` CLI) and in
CI. Each reviewer is a focused agent prompt with a trigger; matched reviewers
run, return a structured verdict, and Bastion aggregates them into one merge
gate. The human sits at the policy layer, authoring and governing reviewers.

**This crate is past the walking-skeleton stage but still partial.** The data and
routing layers are real and tested; the parallel, timeout-bounded runner
(`src/runner.rs`) and all three agent backends (Claude Code, Codex, and Pi, under
`src/backend/`) are implemented and execute reviewers for real over an injectable
subprocess seam. Keep that boundary honest: a backend that cannot produce a valid
verdict returns an error, never a fabricated pass, and gates fail closed on it.

## Source of truth

- `README.md`: sparse user-facing intro, install, and links into the guides.
- `docs/user-guide/`: task-oriented guide for people *using* Bastion (concepts,
  authoring reviewers, the local loop, CI, governance). Progressive disclosure.
- `docs/developer-guide/`: guide for people working on Bastion itself
  (architecture, the backend boundary, conventions), plus the design references:
  - `docs/developer-guide/design.md`: the core system: reviewers, the verdict
    contract, the merge gate, the threat model. The authoritative design reference.
  - `docs/developer-guide/github-adapter.md`: the GitHub CI adapter and governance.
  - `docs/developer-guide/local-surface.md`: the local CLI surface this crate
    implements. The local and GitHub surfaces are deliberate mirror images; keep
    them in sync.
- `.bastion.yaml`: the example reviewer registry at the repository root (the
  `.bastion.yml` spelling is also honored); update it when the schema changes.
- `.agents/skills/readme.md`: repo-local Rust coding skills and their provenance.
- `CLAUDE.md` is a bare `@AGENTS.md` import so guidance does not drift between
  agent surfaces.

## Build, test, and run

```sh
cargo fmt --check
cargo test
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
nudge check
```

`just check` runs all four (install [`nudge`](https://github.com/attunehq/nudge)
first; see CONTRIBUTING.md). Commands:

```sh
bastion --version
bastion review --base main
bastion review --base main --format jsonl
bastion runs
bastion show
bastion transcript <reviewer>
bastion clean --keep 20
bastion github codeowners --owner @your-org/platform
bastion github report --repo OWNER/NAME --pr N --sha SHA
bastion skills install
bastion skills check
bastion skills list
```

## Architecture map

For the full module map and the life of a `bastion review`, see
[`docs/developer-guide/architecture.md`](docs/developer-guide/architecture.md); the
backend boundary is covered in
[`docs/developer-guide/backends.md`](docs/developer-guide/backends.md). The terse
version:

- `build.rs`: derives `BASTION_VERSION` from `git describe --always --tags
  --dirty=-dirty`, with a `BASTION_VERSION` env override and a `Cargo.toml`
  fallback.
- `src/main.rs`: thin binary entrypoint; wires the tokio runtime to
  `bastion::run`.
- `src/lib.rs`: library root; installs `color_eyre` + `tracing` and dispatches.
- `src/version.rs`: exposes the build-derived version string.
- `src/cli.rs`: clap derive command tree and dispatch.
- `src/commands.rs`: one handler per subcommand.
- `src/reviewer.rs` / `src/config.rs`: the declarative reviewer schema and
  registry loading/discovery.
- `src/routing.rs`: compiling trigger globs and matching changed files.
- `src/verdict.rs` / `src/event.rs`: the structured verdict and run-event
  schemas (the `Money` type carries cents but serializes as dollars).
- `src/git.rs`: the git queries the CLI needs (changed files, branch, root).
- `src/paths.rs` / `src/store.rs`: the data-directory layout and run history.
- `src/render.rs`: human and JSONL output.
- `src/runner.rs`: the parallel, timeout-bounded runner: fans matched reviewers
  out over a `JoinSet`, fails closed on error/timeout, streams run events, and
  persists each run.
- `src/backend/`: the agent execution boundary. `mod.rs` defines the `Backend`
  trait, the deterministic `MockBackend`, `dispatch`, and the shared prompt helpers
  (including the fenced-YAML `SCHEMA_INSTRUCTION`/`extract_verdict` that the Codex
  and Pi backends share); `command.rs` is the injectable `CommandRunner` subprocess
  seam; `claude_code.rs`, `codex.rs`, and `pi.rs` are the three real backends, each
  driven against a fake executable in tests. `container/` is the container runner,
  split by concern (`plan.rs` resolves the `ExecutionPlan` and builds/resolves the
  image, `runner.rs` is the `ContainerRunner` decorator and its env-file forwarding,
  `credentials.rs` the provider-credential passthrough, `teardown.rs` the timeout
  force-removal guard): `dispatch` resolves an `ExecutionPlan` (the single place an
  unprovisioned capability tier fails closed), then a reviewer with a `runner` block
  and `capabilities.network: true` runs its backend inside a built/named image via a
  `ContainerRunner` decorator over
  the `CommandRunner` seam (the backend code is untouched; the named container is
  force-removed on a timeout). `network: true` grants a containerized reviewer general
  (unscoped) egress; a container with the default `network: false` fails closed because
  provider-only scoped egress is unbuilt, so a containerized reviewer must opt into
  `network: true`. `mcp`/`skills` still fail closed. All three backends
  (`claude-code`, `codex`, `pi`; `any` maps to Claude Code) are wired and execute
  reviewers for real.
- `src/github/`: the GitHub adapter (the CI surface). `codeowners.rs` generates
  the governance block (pure text, no network); `client.rs` is the REST seam,
  modeled on the backend's `CommandRunner`: a proof-carrying `ApiRequest`, a
  `GitHubApi` trait, the real `reqwest`-backed `RestClient`, and a recording double
  for tests; `report.rs` distills a finished run's event stream into a sticky PR
  comment and check-run payloads (all pure and unit-tested) and posts them. `bastion
  github report` reads a persisted run and posts it: the sticky comment (with every
  finding, optional ones included), a check run per reviewer, and the always-present
  aggregate `bastion` check. Check runs need a GitHub App installation token, so this
  runs under one (the default Actions `GITHUB_TOKEN` qualifies; a classic PAT does
  not). API-created check runs carry no check-suite id, so under the shared
  `github-actions` identity GitHub buckets them into a sibling workflow's suite (they
  render as `Security / <reviewer>`); posting under a dedicated per-adopter app gives
  them their own named suite. `.github/workflows/bastion.yml` mints that app token via
  `actions/create-github-app-token` when the `BASTION_APP_ID`/`BASTION_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`
  secrets exist and falls back to `GITHUB_TOKEN` otherwise; the hosted walkthrough at
  `bastion.jessica.black/github-app` (`site/src/pages/github-app.astro`) drives the
  manifest flow that provisions the app. `report` decides whether to nudge toward a
  dedicated app on its own (no workflow flag): it reads the `app.slug` GitHub stamps
  on the check runs it creates, and when that is the shared `github-actions` identity
  it closes the sticky comment with a note linking to that walkthrough. This is why
  it posts check runs before the comment. See `docs/developer-guide/github-adapter.md`
  (Check-run grouping).
- `src/skills.rs` / `skills/`: the agent skills bundled into the binary. Each
  `skills/<slug>/SKILL.md` is embedded with `include_str!`; `bastion skills
  install` writes it into a consuming repo's `.claude/skills/` and `.agents/skills/`,
  `bastion skills check` fails closed when a checked-in copy has drifted from the
  embedded source (a deterministic, version-independent lint wired into
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml`), and `bastion skills list` shows what is bundled.
  This repo dogfoods the `using-bastion` skill: its agents work *on* Bastion and
  *with* it. Distinct from it are the repo-local skills that guide agents working
  on Bastion: the Rust skills and the `stop-slop` prose skill, which are not
  bundled into the binary and so sit outside `bastion skills install`/`check`. All
  of these live under both `.agents/skills/` (the agent-neutral convention) and
  `.claude/skills/` (Claude Code's native path), kept as exact copies so every
  skill is available through either surface; `tests/skills_mirror.rs` fails the
  build if the two trees drift.
- `tests/integration/`: the end-to-end suite (one `integration` test target).
  `main.rs` holds the scenarios; the reusable support is split into sibling modules
  (`fakes.rs` for the `rustc`-compiled fake agent and fake container engine,
  `fixtures.rs` for the throwaway `git` repo / `Reviewer` / registry / run-event
  helpers, `github.rs` for the in-process fake GitHub). It drives the *real compiled
  `bastion` binary* (`CARGO_BIN_EXE_bastion`), each scenario in its own throwaway
  `git` repo and private `BASTION_DATA_DIR`, against the fake agent wired in via
  `BASTION_CLAUDE_BIN`/`BASTION_CODEX_BIN`/`BASTION_PI_BIN` (and the fake engine via
  `BASTION_CONTAINER_ENGINE` for the container scenarios). The fake reads per-reviewer
  `env` (which Bastion propagates into the child) to stage passes, blocks, malformed
  output, crashes, and hangs, so the suite exercises the full subprocess path,
  fail-closed/fail-open aggregation, concurrency, persistence, and the read-back
  commands at scale. One scenario also drives `bastion github report` against the
  in-process fake GitHub (the binary's `GITHUB_API_URL` is pointed at it), asserting
  the real comment and check-run requests with no network. It detect-and-skips when
  `rustc`/`git` are absent.
- `scripts/install.sh` / `scripts/install.ps1`: the public install scripts
  (`curl | bash` and `irm | iex`). They detect the platform, download the matching
  release archive plus `checksums.txt`, verify the SHA-256, and place `bastion` on
  the user's `PATH`. They fail closed on any checksum problem; `tests/script_safety.rs`
  pins that. `.github/workflows/installers.yml` smoke-tests them against published
  releases on a schedule (not in PR CI, since it depends on release state).

## Development rules

- Do not preserve backwards compatibility by default. Mention breakage plainly.
- Weigh breakage by who actually consumes the thing. The artifact downstream users
  depend on is the `bastion` binary and its surfaces: the CLI, the verdict/event
  schema, the install scripts, and the bundled skills. A change that could wedge or
  break *those* is a real risk to weigh and call out. This repo's *own* CI is not
  one of those surfaces: users run `bastion`, not our workflows, and they do not copy
  `.github/workflows/*` verbatim (the docs show an illustrative example, but each
  team writes its own). So a change that might wedge Bastion's *own* self-review gate
  (for example `.github/workflows/bastion.yml`, which dogfoods the adapter) is only a
  minor inconvenience: the maintainer can admin-merge past a stuck gate. Do not
  contort a design to avoid self-wedging our CI, and do not add break-glass machinery
  for it. In practice, changes to our GitHub Actions workflows are nearly always safe
  to make boldly; reserve the caution for changes to the binary and its surfaces.
- Keep the local surface and the GitHub adapter as mirror images: the same
  reviewers, verdicts, and findings, presented through whatever each transport
  makes natural. A schema change touches both surfaces and `docs/`.
- Reviewers are declarative and static. Do not add code paths that generate
  reviewers on the fly; that would break the stable trigger set and the
  governance story.
- When you fix an issue, consider whether the class of issue is one a Bastion
  reviewer could catch in future changesets (a recurring bug pattern, a convention
  that keeps getting violated, a footgun in the schema or CLI surface). If so,
  suggest adding or extending a reviewer in `.bastion.yaml` and say what
  its concern and trigger would be. Do not add the reviewer yourself: reviewers are
  governed policy, so leave the decision to the user.
- Gates fail closed. A gate that cannot produce a valid verdict is a block, never
  a silent pass. Advisors fail open.
- Do not use mocks for collaborators; prefer real pure functions and real
  filesystem/git fixtures (`tempfile`, throwaway `git init` repos), as the
  existing tests do. `MockBackend` is a deliberate deterministic test/dev double
  for the agent boundary, not a general mocking pattern.
- Follow the repo-local Rust skills (under `.agents/skills/`, mirrored to
  `.claude/skills/`): parse-don't-validate at boundaries, newtypes over
  stringly-typed data, and the clippy lint groups in `Cargo.toml`.
- Keep user-facing prose (the marketing site, the guides, the README) free of
  AI-register slop: state mechanisms, not the product's character. Follow the
  `stop-slop` skill (under `.claude/skills/stop-slop/`, mirrored to
  `.agents/skills/`), which catches the structural tells. The `prose-anti-slop`
  gate in `.bastion.yaml` blocks the merge on slop in changed prose.
- Use plain ASCII quotes in docs, comments, and generated text. No em dashes or
  en dashes, and no literal `--` used as a dash in prose; recast with a comma, a
  colon, or parentheses.

## Releases

Bastion ships as a binary on GitHub Releases. It is not published to crates.io, so
a release is just a tag, never a crates.io publish.

- To cut a release, push a tag in the shape `vX.Y.Z` to the remote (for example
  `git tag v0.2.0 && git push origin v0.2.0`). The
  [release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml) fires on `v*` tags, builds the
  platform matrix, and opens a draft GitHub Release for a human to publish.
- Do not bump the crate version in `Cargo.toml`. Leave `version = "0.0.0"` as it is:
  it is a deliberate placeholder, not a real version. The released binary's
  `--version` comes from the git tag (CI passes the tag through `BASTION_VERSION`;
  locally `build.rs` runs `git describe`). The `Cargo.toml` version is only a
  build-time fallback, not the source of truth, and is never published.
- A tag with a pre-release suffix (`v0.2.0-rc.1`) ships as a prerelease.

The full release runbook (the build matrix and version derivation) lives in
`CONTRIBUTING.md`. There is no self-review pin to bump: the
`.github/workflows/bastion.yml` gate always runs the latest published release, so it
adopts a new engine automatically once the release is published.

## Verification expectations

Run the core checks for ordinary changes:

```sh
cargo fmt --check
cargo test
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
nudge check
```

`nudge check` enforces the mechanical conventions in `.nudge.yaml` (today: no
Unicode dashes in authored text). It runs in CI and as an agent-time hook, and
gates the same way locally; the `prose-anti-slop` gate in
`.bastion.yaml` covers the prose-voice judgment a regex cannot.

Also run targeted checks when relevant:

- Versioning changes: run `bastion --version`.
- Schema changes: update `.bastion.yaml` and the docs under `docs/`.
- Public scaffolding changes: keep `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`,
  `NOTICE`, and the GitHub workflows in sync.
- Rule changes: validate `.nudge.yaml` with `nudge validate` and confirm
  `nudge check` is clean.
